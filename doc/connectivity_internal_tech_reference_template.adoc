//
// This document is a template for an Internal Technical Reference.
// The goal of the generated document is to allow to install, configure and use a connector to anyone who needs to use it. We're assuming this document we'll be used by an internal Team at Mulesoft with a technical understanding of the "connectivity environment" (especially Engineering and Support teams).
// Please, if you'd like to modify this template, create a new branch in GitHub with the changes and then create a pull request. Modification are more than welcome!

= Mule <name of the connector> - Internal Technical Reference Document

== <name _of_the_target_system> 
// Information about the target system

=== Documentation links

//Documentation used by the conn dev to build it.


== Sandbox
// We distinguish connectors among three categories:
// SAAS (Sandbox (infrastructure) provided by the target-system). For example: Concur. Uncomment:
// SAAS Sandbox
// === Steps to configure the environment
// === Initial configuration
// On-Premise : Sandbox created by the connectivity team or specialized contractor. For example: Siebel, Sharepoint.
// === Steps to install 
// === Steps to configure the Sandbox
// === Initial configuration
// Standalone: software runnning in the local machine. (Kafka)
// === Steps to install 
// === Initial configuration


== Authentication methods
=== Available for the platform
//For the latest version we support. Enumerate all the authentication methods documented (or link to a reference page).
=== Currently available in the connector
// Explain the available current methods (no need to document the configuration, it should be available in the User Manual).

== Troubleshooting
=== Communication debug 
// Messages sent to the platform
== Entry points 
// Where to put breakpoints.
// Into a "standard" connector, you can uncomment and complete the next section. For other kinds of connectors (WSDL to Connector, SOAPConnect, etc.) please document. You can modify this standard section and add it as a different section:

// STANDARD DEBUGGING-------------
//On the connector class <nameOfConnector>Connector.java find the processor you’d like to debug (@Processor). The name of the processor is defined by friendlyName decorator parameter, or if the parameter is absent, by the name of the method.

//for Example, in org.mule.modules.zuora.ZuoraConnector.java

//*   Invoke SOAP Service processor→ is implemented by the method decorated with @Processor(friendlyName = "Invoke SOAP Service")

//*   getExportFileContent processor→ getExportFileContent method decorated by @Processor


== Logging from platform side 
// How to gatther logs into the platform side -target system
